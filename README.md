GuessTheNumber is a simple console-based game written in Java where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between a specified range. The player has a limited number of attempts per round to guess the number correctly. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the player decides to stop, and then it displays the average number of attempts per round.
